_Coding runs the world as we know it_, but **the vast majority of people aren’t even aware of its existence**, let alone what it even is, despite the fact that **coding is vital for most of the contemporary businesses**. That's why those who choose to **learn to code** (_whether with [one online course](https://www.bitdegree.org/goon/introduction-to-python-programming-udemy), [or another](https://www.bitdegree.org/goon/edx-homepage)_) are in high demand for employers.

Before we start digging deeper, I want you to **try to answer "What is Coding?" for yourself...**

Now, **right-click somewhere inside your browser window**, and select ‘**View Page Source**’. Scroll through the window that pops up and see if you recognize or understand anything.

As you may have expected, you were just **viewing the code behind this webpage**, or the **[document object model ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)**(DOM). That means, that you see the full markup of the page and if you have learned at least the basics **[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) or [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)**, it might be easier to spot some familiar tags and elements.

Now, in simple terms, l*et’s define coding as the basic act of writing* – in a programming language – **a script that a computer can understand**. This script will tell the computer **to behave in a certain way**, to do a certain thing, and to, ultimately, **perform the actions that you want it to** – *if your code is right*.

## Code As a ‘Translator’

<!--StartFragment-->

What is coding? While we have defined coding as **the act of writing a script in a language that your computer can understand**, let’s get down and dirty and have a look at some coding background.

**Computers don't understand human language** and in order for us to see some results (like displaying a web page), we have to **write it in a way that the computer would understand.**

**_Coding 101_** - *Think of your code as a translator between English (or whatever language you speak) and Binary. If you can do this, it will suddenly become much easier to grasp the basics of what is coding.*

So, think about it this way: your machine **only really speaks Binary**, but it understands **different coding languages**. In the same way, *you only really speak your native language,* but you understand the same coding languages (if you at least have the basics of some, of course).

The fact that **both you and your computer share a common understanding of programming languages means that you can communicate with each other** - just like you did when you clicked to come to this article!

## Why Should I Learn Coding?

Now that we have touched on *the basics of coding,* it’s time to take a look at a few of the reasons **why you should think seriously about learning to code**.

Coding can have huge impacts on both your **personal and your professional life**. Some of the major reasons why everyone should learn to code or at least understand what is coding:

- **It will increase your earning potential massively -** Experienced coders and programmers can **charge extremely high hourly rates**, especially if they are working as freelance or contract developers.\
  \
  Many coders **won’t work for less than $100 per hour**, which will give you an income to live up to all your wildest dreams. And the best thing? The fact that there is a shortage of coders out there means that people will happily pay you ridiculous amounts, *especially once you have some experience*.
- **You could work for yourself -** While many people who understand what is coding hold down **traditional contracts at large companies**, a huge percentage choose to **work in freelance roles**.\
  \
  As a freelance coder, you will have **the ability to work where you want to,** **when you want to, and how you want to**. In reality, there is so much work out there for coders that you will be able to only work on projects that you enjoy.
- **You can work on your projects -** If you have an entrepreneurial streak, then learning how to code could be the trigger that results in you **developing the next viral app or website.** Knowing to go out there and create things that before you could only have dreamed of is a wonderful thing - believe me!

These are just a few of the reasons **why you should learn to code** and not only know what is coding. Doing so will also ensure that you are never out of work, that you will have the ability to understand the technology and the world around you as it develops, and that you will be able to say no to uninteresting job offers.

Don’t believe me? Get out there and have a **[go at coding 101 or learning coding basics](https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/)** today. *What do you have to lose?*

## What Types Of Coders Are There?

To fully understand the coding background, you need to know that **there is a wide range of different types of coders out there**. Each of them **specializes in a different thing**, and each of them is required to learn different languages and techniques that allow them to specialize in these things.

Although we have explained what is coding and **three of the most common types of coders below**, there are many, many more. Some of the other types not touched on include **systems engineers, game developers, and AI programmers** - among others.

### Front-End Developer

**[Front-end developers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development)** are **the people who build websites**. They are responsible for the **design, layout, and the way content appears on a webpage**. This is done in several ways, but the most popular **front-end languages are [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Some of the **main responsibilities** of a front-end web developer include:

- Taking design and turning it into a website by *writing hundreds of lines of code* (trust me, it’s more fun than it sounds!).
- Making sure that the website in question is **functional and interactive** as required. This includes doing things like **inserting animations, creating hyperlinked buttons, and more.**
- **Minimizing page load speed times** and **maximizing page responsiveness**. Things like this play a major role in a website’s **[search engine optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization)** (SEO) score, and it is important to get them right.

As you can see, a front-end web developer **has a lot of roles**. However, they are mainly **quite simple and easy to learn**. Especially if you choose to take some well-designed courses on **[Udemy](https://www.bitdegree.org/goon/udemy)**, **[Udacity](https://www.bitdegree.org/goon/udacity-homepage)**, or **[edX](https://www.bitdegree.org/goon/edx-homepage)**.

Unfortunately, front-end developers are probably among the **lowest-paid specialists** who know what is coding and programming - *but don’t let this put you off!*

### Back-End Developer

Although a **front-end developer is responsible for the major design and interactivity features** of a website, the **[back-end developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_end_and_back_end)** is the person who **builds the web apps that the website runs on**.

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

Web apps are **complex applications** that are designed to do a certain thing and are built into a website’s underlying code.

Some of the things that web apps built by back-end developers **allow you to do include:**

- **Log in and out** of a website once you have created an account.
- **Connect with friends and build a user profile**. Social sites like *Facebook* and *Twitter* are great examples of this sort of thing.
- Create **interactive apps** that can be embedded on a website. *Google Maps* is a great example of this sort of app.

Back-end developers require a sound understanding of what is coding and languages like **[Ruby](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)>) (and the [Ruby on Rails framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails)**), **[Python](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>)**, full-stack **[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)**, and **[PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP)**.

Back-end developers are **in high demand**, which means that they **command higher salaries** on average than front-end developers and that there is a lot of work available.

### Mobile App Developer

Although you may think that this is *pretty self-explanatory*, it is still worth going over. Mobile app developers **create apps for iOS and Android** operating systems (surprise surprise!).

<!--EndFragment-->

![Mobile Image](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526498460520-4c246339dccb?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D&auto=format&fit=crop&w=870&q=80 'Mobile Development ')

<!--StartFragment-->

_There is a huge demand for mobile apps_. Apps like **Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram** have already taken the world by storm - who’s to say that you can’t create something similar?

But, before you do that, you will need to learn what is coding and also **learn a mobile programming language.** If you would like to program **iOS apps,** you will need to learn either **[Objective-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C)** or **[Swift](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)>)**. Both of these languages are used alongside the development tool **[Xcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode)**.

Android development is done primarily with **[Java](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)>)**, *one of the most versatile languages in the world.* To use Java to develop mobile apps you will need to learn how to use a tool called the **Android Studio**.

One of the newer programming languages, **[Kotlin](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)>)**, is beginning to take over from Java and gain a significant market share. However, **Java looks set to remain the most popular for the foreseeable future.**

If you want to learn mobile development, you will need to learn one of these languages. If any of them interest you, head over to **[Udacity](https://www.bitdegree.org/goon/udacity-homepage)**, **[Coursera](https://www.bitdegree.org/goon/coursera)**, or **[edX](https://www.bitdegree.org/goon/edx-homepage)**,[ ](https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/)and start learning!
