## **5 Steps To Help You Find Out What To Do Next In Life**

### **1. Take Time Out**

The first thing you should do, if you don’t know what to do, is do nothing.

Take time out to sit with the unknown.

You don’t have to hide away from the world by going away on a retreat for a month to sort out your life.

But if you can do this, then more power to you!

**Taking time out could mean cutting back on non-essential tasks and activities, freeing up more time each day for you to just ‘be.’**

### **2. Feel Your Emotions**

With a little extra time to yourself, you may find that feelings that were previously hidden away or covered up because you were too busy will surface.

You cannot avoid your emotions (*although many people try by indulging in addictive behaviors*).

When you feel and examine your emotions, you find that they have something to teach you.

You may experience doubt, apathy, or even panic about your future.

Emotions left unattended by the conscious mind, such as anger or frustration, can manifest in your body in a physical form (*e.g. upset stomach*).

Don’t ignore them.

What often keeps people in a state of indecision is fear.

Fear is at the root of many of the so-called [negative emotions](https://everydaypower.com/do-not-avoid-emotional-pain/).

But fear could also be mixed with excitement, hope, and elation.

There is a wide spectrum of emotions to be experienced—feel whatever is arising and know that these will eventually pass.

The more time you spend acknowledging your feelings, the less scary your emotions will seem.

### **4. Take Inspired Action**

*Can you recall a time in your life when you tried everything in your power to make something happen, but it just wasn’t happening?*

Chances are that this path wasn’t meant for you, or the timing wasn’t right.

The universe had other plans for you.

As you [explore your passions](https://everydaypower.com/find-your-passion/), it’s vital for you to take inspired action.

Inspired action means you feel good about taking the next step and are moving ahead with conscious awareness.

If you are just doing things because you feel you have to, you might be [addicted to being busy](https://everydaypower.com/addicted-to-being-busy/) and not even know it, and ultimately left feeling overwhelmed.

If you’re trying too hard to figure out your life or taking on too many new things to discover your passions, it’s time to go back to step one and take a break!

### **5. Let Go Of The Outcome**

You may refuse to take a step forward in life because you don’t know what to expect.

You don’t know the outcome; therefore, fear creeps in.

This keeps you in a state of inaction.

*But what if you let go of the outcome?*

How boring would life be if you knew exactly how each day would turn out from day one?

There is a sense of intrigue when you don’t know precisely how life will be when faced with changing direction.

Don’t let fear stop you from exploring possibilities.

Remain open to whatever life presents.

It may surprise you with an even better outcome than you could have imagined.

But life has a wonderful way of encouraging (*sometimes forcing*) you to change when you stop going with the flow.

Embrace the unknown for a while.

Follow these five steps to prevent yourself from being stuck in indecision for months or years.
